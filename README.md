# Micro Reddit

> A simple Ruby on Rails App - Building with Active Record.


The project consisted of adding multiple models, creating the migrations, adding validations and associations between the models.
 - First task was creating the User model and the validations for name and email
 - Then, to create the Post model and the validations for title and text
 - In the next step we needed to set up associations between the User and Post model
 - Next was testing those associations between the two models
 - After that we needed to create the Comment model and the validations for the text
 - The next step consisted of adding associations between the User, Post and Comment models
   - After this step the User should be able to create many Posts, and add many Comments on different Posts
   - A Post should belong only to the user who wrote it
   - A Comment should belong to only one post, and only one user
 - The last step was to test out the associations between the three models
